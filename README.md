# Crowdfunding_ETL
## Overview
The goal of this analysis was to explore the data from backers who have pledged to live projects. By using Python, Pandas and Jupyter notebook, we will extract and transform the data. We will additionally use an ETL process on the dataset to create a DataFrame and use SQL queries to construct our data analysis.
